Here are important notes from the designer passed to you by the company. You must use this information in your work. 
The background of each fieldset is lightyellow e.g. background:lightyellow.
The border of each fieldset is yellow, with 10px width e.g. border:10px solid yellow
The fieldset needs to have margin-bottom:10px
The width of each fieldset is 720px
The width of each label is 180px
The label text needs to have display:inline-block
The label text needs to be right-align and top-align 
The labels of the checkbox and the radio needs to have width:auto
For the words on both sides of the two range, you can use any appropriate style e.g. text-align:center
The textarea needs to be width:360px and height:50px

You can use class wherever you think it is appropriate. However, remember that there is no use of inline styles anywhere in this assessment. So that means you cannot do something like this:

  <input type="email" style="background:pink" ... 

Instead, all style must be appropriately handled in the style section.
